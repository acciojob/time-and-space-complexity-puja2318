	<h1> Time and Space Complexity </h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a type of coputational complaxity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm.
		The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete.o,
		the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task 
		(considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). 
		The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in
		terms of the time complexity. </p>
	<p>  The <b> Space Complexity </b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, 
		including the space of input values for execution. The <b>space complexity </b>of an algorithm or a data 
		structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a 
		function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.
		This includes the memory space used by its inputs, called input space, and any other (auxiliary) memory
		it uses during execution, which is called auxiliary space.Similar to time complexity, <b>space complexity</b>
		is often expressed asymptotically in bigO notation, such as O(n),  O(n\log n),O(n^{\alpha),O(2^{n}), etc. where n is a characteristic of the input influencing 
		<b>space complexity</b>.</p>
